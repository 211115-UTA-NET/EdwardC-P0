// Hello, my name is Edward Cicio. I will use this comment
// to guide you through my presentation. 







// My project talk about Bike Store that sell bike parts. Therefore my target audience is
// any age range who love to ride bike. Even cycle biker, road biker, and Mountain biker too.
// Even this will help Store owner to manage their store. This app have access with Azura Database,
// where you can store lots of information includes invoices of customer order or store invoices.
// Before we go ahead to show our app.







// I want to make sure that you are aware of Mode. 
// When I say Login mode, New Customer Mode, etc.… It is basic guide to help the
// program know where to go 







// Here is the Step Instructions.
// 1. When we open the app, we will enter Login Screen (Login Mode). The app will ask us to choose
//    either New Customer, Returned Customer (or Manager), or Exit(Close the app).







// 2. First, we will choose New Customer (Mode). The program will inform us to fill out the
//    information followed by First Name, Last Name, Phone Number (up to 10 digit), Address,
//    username, and password.







// 3. After we finish fill the information, we will enter Customer Request Mode, where we will choose a
//    store location to shopping.







// 4. After pick a location, then we will have few choices from menu: View your Invoices (your order history),
//    Item’s details, View store’s Invoice (Store History), Ready to order, and Exit.







// 5. First, My Invoices (Which will be empty due to new customer).
//    Secondly, Item’s detail.
//    Thirdly, Store’s invoices based on location.
//       By normal, for customer to look store's invoices. I plan to
//       add most popular item on top and unpopular on bottom in the future development.
//       This idea will help the customers to decide which item to buy or how many quantities
//       they may need. Include order date to know which season is better to buy.
//    And lastly, Ready to order (Change to Set Order Mode).







// 6. The program will display the store inventory based on the location that we choose from Customer
//    Request. After that, the program will prompt us to choose which item and how many quantities
//    that we want to order. 







// 7. Even if we order more quantity than the store’s quantity. Then the program will reject our order and
//    ask us to input again. 







// 8. Once approved our order, the program will add our order in our list. Then the program
//    will ask us to process (Change to Process Order Mode) or continue order
//    (Add another item into our cart).







// 9. When we type ‘process’, the program will prompt us to final confirm.
//    It is same as we see the total price, then decide to go ahead pay or cancel the order.







// 10. At first, the program will display our list of order and final price.
//     Then prompt us to input either ‘yes’ or ‘no’







// 11. If we choose ‘yes’, then the program will start process our order (Also update our Invoices)
//     and change to Logout Mode. If we choose ‘no’, then the program will cancel our order and change
//     to Logout Mode. 







// 12. After choosing ‘yes’ or ‘no’, the program will prompt us to logout or continue shopping







// 13. If we choose to log out, then the program will change into Login Mode.
//     If we choose to continue shopping, then the program will change to Customer Request Mode.







// 14. For now, we will choose to continue shopping to show you that our cart is added
//     into our invoices and store’s invoice. After this, I will do choose Exit to logout
//     then login as Manager.







// 15. When we login as Manager, the program will change into Manager Request Mode,
//     instead Customer Request as last time.







// 16. As Manager,
//     1) check our store’s invoice (see history either our choose
//     location or display all store.)
//     2) check our store’s inventory based on location
//     or all stores.
//     3) search customer's first name in our database system.
//     After that, we just choose to log out.







// 17. We are done with app. 







// For database, I have 8 Tables in total. I have a diagram in SQL Management.







// Any questions you may have for me? Please comment your question in the chat,
// so I can answer your questions.
